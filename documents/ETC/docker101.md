what is Docker and why is it popular? 

Docker is a platform for maintaining apps in containers. Containers are a form of OS-level virtualization, which means that it does not contain any OS 

Virtualization vs. containers

- Hypervisor vs docker daemon 
- On a single computer (OS), a hypervisor is installed, which manages  all the virtual machines. 
- Each virtual machine has its own kernel and OS

Benefits of using containers 

- lightweight

- portable 

- fast 
- No hypervisor (no separate kernel)
