### DFT 

1. Understanding the DFT formula 

$$
X(\omega_k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(t_n)e^{-j\omega_kt_n}
$$

DFT at frequency $\omega_{k}$ tells us how much of that frequency is in the input signal. 

Therefore, geometrically, the equation above is the projection of the input signal onto the complex sinusoid. 

In the same note, it can be rewritten as the inner product of the input signal and the kth complex sinusoid. 
$$
X(\omega_k) = <x, s_k>
$$


2. Complex sinusoids are the "kernel" of the transform (DFT, IDFT) => the eigenvectors. 

3. The mapping between signal and spectrum

Questions

### Euler's identity 

$$
e^{j\theta} = cos\theta + jsin\theta
$$

$e^{j\theta}$ is a complex sinusoid (complex exponential). It is composed of a real (cos) and an imaginary part (sin). 

Some definitions 
$$
j := \sqrt(-1)
$$

$$
e := lim_{n-> \infty} (1+1/n)^n
$$

So why is the euler's identiy important? Where does it come from? 

First, the euler's identity can be derived using taylor expansion.

1. Using the taylor expansion of $e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + ... + \frac{x^k}{k! }+ ...$, substitute $x = j\theta$. 
   $$
   e^{j\theta} = 1 + j\theta + \frac{(j\theta)^2}{2!} + \frac{(j\theta)^3}{3!} + ... + \frac{(j\theta)^k}{k!} + ...
   $$

2. Compute powers of $j$ and group real and imaginary parts together. 
   $$
   e^{j\theta} = [1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2!} + \frac{\theta^4}{4!} + ...] + j[\theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!} + \frac{\theta^5}{5!} + ...]
   $$

3. Realize that the real part is the taylor expansion of cosine and imaginary part is that of sine. 

$$
e^{j\theta} = cos\theta + jsin\theta
$$

Damn!!! 



Now why is it important? What does it tell us? 

* When a signal is projected onto this complex sinusoid, the even part of the signal is projected onto the real part of the complex sinusoid and the odd part of the signal is projected onto the imaginary part.  
  
  * Because cosine = even function, sine = odd function
* Cosine is in-phase and Sine is in phase quadrature, so this means that by using both cosine and sine, we can represent any phase. 

* Can represent complex number, $z$, in both rectangular and polar form.

  How? 

  Rectangular form is $z_0 = x_0 + jy_0$

  Since we can represent $x_0 = rcos\theta$ and $y_0 = rain\theta$, 
  $$
  z_0 = rcos\theta + jsin\theta
  $$
  Using euler's identity, we can represent complex number $z$ in polar form. 
  $$
  z_0 = re^{j\theta}
  $$
  

  

Some euler's identity corollaries 

1. $$
   e^{j\pi} + 1 = 0 
   $$

   By setting $\theta = \pi$ in the euler's formula, you get "the most beautiful equation" in math. Sure, sure. 

2. $$
   e^{j\theta} = cos\theta + jsin\theta  
   $$

   $$
   e^{-j\theta} = cos\theta - jsin\theta
   $$

   Adding the above 2 equations gives
   $$
   cos\theta = \frac{e^{j\theta} + e^{-j\theta}}{2}
   $$
   Subtracting the two gives
   $$
   sin\theta = \frac{e^{j\theta} - e^{-j\theta}}{2j}
   $$

3. De Moivre's thorem
   $$
   [cos\theta + jsin\theta]^n = cos(n\theta) + jsin(n\theta)
   $$
   This can be proven so easily using the euler's identity. 



### Positive and negative frequency 

I've been confused about what this meant, but I guess you are not supposed to interpret it literally. 

From the definition of cosine and sine (aka. the "real" sinusoids) from above, we can see that each of them is a sum of two complex sinusoids in equal contribution. 

$e^{j\theta}$ is a positive frequency component, which rotates counter clockwise. 

$e^{-j\theta}$ is a negative frequency component, which rotates clockwise.

In fact, the real sinusoids are a sum of a positive and a negative frequency complex sinusoids, resulting in the cancellation of the imaginary parts.

So we can say that real sinusoids are more complex than the complex sinusoids :P 



## 3/3 

머리 뽀개지겠네? 근데 이제 말들이 이해가 되기 시작함. 

### Terms 

* Modulus => radius 

* DC component : frequency가 0인 것 

### Instantaneous phase and frequency

* Initial phase = $\phi$

* Instantaneous phase = $\theta (t) = \omega t + \phi$

* Instantaneous frequency = $f_{If} = \frac{d}{dt} \theta (t) * \frac{1}{2\pi}$

* "Inst. freq is the temporal rate of the inst. phase"...



### Frequency sampling에 대한 이해 

$$
\omega_k = \frac{2\pi}{N}k
$$

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1go6gkmt03xj20hf0f3gpl.jpg" alt="DFT-21 copy" style="zoom:50%;" />

원은 $2\pi$ 이니까 여기서 N개의 frequency를 샘플링하는 것. 

### DFT 

$$
X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] * e^{-j2\pi kn/N}
$$

이 수식을 다시 보자면, $X[k]$ 는 kth frequency의 spectrum이다. 

Input signal을 N개로 샘플링을 한다면, N개의 frequency sample에 대해서 각각 spectrum을 구하는 것이라고 한다. (N개의 input signal -> N개의 frequency spectrum) ---- 왜?? 

즉, NxN의 matrix를 계산하는 것. 

예를 들어 N=4일때, 각 frequency 마다의 complex sinusoid는 이렇다.

그럼 이걸로 $x=[1,-1,1,-1]$ 의 input signal의 DFT를 구한다면, 아래와 같이 frequency index=2인 친구만 4의 amplitude로 존재한다는걸 계산할 수 있다. 나머진 다 0이다. 즉, input signal $x$는 complex sinusoid basis 중 하나라는 뜻. 실제 오디오 프로세싱할때 이런 일은 없을 것이야.

DFT를 한문장으로 요약하자면, 

DFT is a projection of the input signal onto a finite set of complex sinusoids, so to find out how much of each complex sinusoids are present in the input signal. 



### Phase and magnitude of DFT 

Phase가 대체 뭔지 정확히 감이 안잡혔는데 이해했다. 

Spectrum은 각 frequency마다 amplitude랑 phase를 나타내주는데, amplitude는 input signal에서 그 frequency가 얼마만큼 있는지, phase는 그 frequency의 $t_0$이 어딘지를 알려주는 것이다.

단순히 생각하자면, input signal이 아래 3개의 complex sinusoid의 합이라고 친다. 

Phase=0일때의 complex sinusoid와 다르게 각각의 frequency들의 시작점이 다 다른걸 볼 수 있다. 이게 DFT에서 계산되는 phase이다.

## 3/4

### DFT

In DFT, the value $N$ covers exactly 1 period of the input signal. 

So then why do we also sample frequency N times? So that inverse DFT work? IDK!!! 

교수님한테 물어볼래...

### Inverse DFT

Synthesizing/reconstructing the input signal from spectrum. 
$$
x[n] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X[k]e^{j2\pi kn/N}
$$
This still feels like magic. 



### Statically-typed language

Type checking happens during compile-time or run-time.

Img from [medium article](https://medium.com/android-news/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b#:~:text=A%20language%20is%20statically%2Dtyped,%2C%20FORTRAN%2C%20Pascal%20and%20Scala.)



In statically typed language, type checking happens during compile-time. Therefore, when you declare (and therefore bind) a variable with a type, you cannot change it later in the code. However, in dynamically-typed language, like python, you can. 

```
int data;
data = 5;
data = "Yo what are you doing?"
```

This will cause type error in Scala, C, etc, but is totally find in Python. 



Weakly vs strongly-typed 

* Weak means each variable's type 

* Strong means each variable can only be associated with one type and its type will not be changed no matter what 

```
data = "Yo I am back"
data = data + 3
```

If this runs without error, it means that the programming language is weakly-typed (Python, C).

If an error is raised, it is strongly typed. 



C is weakly-typed and statically-typed. 



### First-class functions

Means that functions can be used like values (integers, strings, etc).
