### DFT 

1. Understanding the DFT formula 

$$
X(\omega_k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(t_n)e^{-j\omega_kt_n}
$$

DFT at frequency $\omega_{k}$ tells us how much of that frequency is in the input signal. 

Therefore, geometrically, the equation above is the projection of the input signal onto the complex sinusoid. 

In the same note, it can be rewritten as the inner product of the input signal and the kth complex sinusoid. 
$$
X(\omega_k) = <x, s_k>
$$
 

2. Complex sinusoids are the "kernel" of the transform (DFT, IDFT) => the eigenvectors. 

3. The mapping between signal and spectrum

Questions 

* Why do we only use N samples in the frequency domain?
