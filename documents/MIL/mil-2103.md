### DFT 

1. Understanding the DFT formula 

$$
X(\omega_k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(t_n)e^{-j\omega_kt_n}
$$

DFT at frequency $\omega_{k}$ tells us how much of that frequency is in the input signal. 

Therefore, geometrically, the equation above is the projection of the input signal onto the complex sinusoid. 

In the same note, it can be rewritten as the inner product of the input signal and the kth complex sinusoid. 
$$
X(\omega_k) = <x, s_k>
$$


2. Complex sinusoids are the "kernel" of the transform (DFT, IDFT) => the eigenvectors. 

3. The mapping between signal and spectrum

### Euler's identity 

$$
e^{j\theta} = cos\theta + jsin\theta
$$

$e^{j\theta}$ is a complex sinusoid (complex exponential). It is composed of a real (cos) and an imaginary part (sin). 

Some definitions 
$$
j := \sqrt(-1)
$$

$$
e := lim_{n-> \infty} (1+1/n)^n
$$

So why is the euler's identiy important? Where does it come from? 

First, the euler's identity can be derived using taylor expansion.

1. Using the taylor expansion of $e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + ... + \frac{x^k}{k! }+ ...$, substitute $x = j\theta$. 
   $$
   e^{j\theta} = 1 + j\theta + \frac{(j\theta)^2}{2!} + \frac{(j\theta)^3}{3!} + ... + \frac{(j\theta)^k}{k!} + ...
   $$

2. Compute powers of $j$ and group real and imaginary parts together. 
   $$
   e^{j\theta} = [1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2!} + \frac{\theta^4}{4!} + ...] + j[\theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!} + \frac{\theta^5}{5!} + ...]
   $$

3. Realize that the real part is the taylor expansion of cosine and imaginary part is that of sine. 

$$
e^{j\theta} = cos\theta + jsin\theta
$$

Damn!!! 



Now why is it important? What does it tell us? 

* When a signal is projected onto this complex sinusoid, the even part of the signal is projected onto the real part of the complex sinusoid and the odd part of the signal is projected onto the imaginary part.  
  
  * Because cosine = even function, sine = odd function
* Cosine is "in phase" and Sine is in "phase quadrature", so this means that by using both cosine and sine, we can represent any phase. 

* Can represent complex number, $z$, in both rectangular and polar form. 

  <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1go5efmwzqgj20se0hz75i.jpg" alt="DFT-15" style="zoom: 40%;" />

  How? 

  Rectangular form is $z_0 = x_0 + jy_0$

  Since we can represent $x_0 = rcos\theta$ and $y_0 = rain\theta$, 
  $$
  z_0 = rcos\theta + jsin\theta
  $$
  Using euler's identity, we can represent complex number $z$ in polar form. 
  $$
  z_0 = re^{j\theta}
  $$
  

  

Some euler's identity corollaries 

1. $$
   e^{j\pi} + 1 = 0 
   $$

   By setting $\theta = \pi$ in the euler's formula, you get "the most beautiful equation" in math. Sure, sure. 

2. $$
   e^{j\theta} = cos\theta + jsin\theta  
   $$

   $$
   e^{-j\theta} = cos\theta - jsin\theta
   $$

   Adding the above 2 equations gives
   $$
   cos\theta = \frac{e^{j\theta} + e^{-j\theta}}{2}
   $$
   Subtracting the two gives
   $$
   sin\theta = \frac{e^{j\theta} - e^{-j\theta}}{2j}
   $$

3. De Moivre's thorem
   $$
   [cos\theta + jsin\theta]^n = cos(n\theta) + jsin(n\theta)
   $$
   This can be proven so easily using the euler's identity. 



### Positive and negative frequency 

I've been confused about what this meant, but I guess you are not supposed to interpret it literally. 

From the definition of cosine and sine (aka. the "real" sinusoids) from above, we can see that each of them is a sum of two complex sinusoids in equal contribution. 

$e^{j\theta}$ is a positive frequency component, which rotates counter clockwise. 

$e^{-j\theta}$ is a negative frequency component, which rotates clockwise. 

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1go5ev9k5w1j20t50gm3zo.jpg" alt="DFT-15 2" style="zoom:40%;" />

In fact, the real sinusoids are a sum of a positive and a negative frequency complex sinusoids, resulting in the cancellation of the imaginary parts.

So we can say that real sinusoids are more complex than the complex sinusoids :P

머리 뽀개지겠네? 근데 이제 말들이 이해가 되기 시작함. 

### Terms 

* Modulus => radius 

* DC component : frequency가 0인 것 

### Instantaneous phase and frequency

* Initial phase = $\phi$

* Instantaneous phase = $\theta (t) = \omega t + \phi$

* Instantaneous frequency = $f_{If} = \frac{d}{dt} \theta (t) * \frac{1}{2\pi}$

* "Inst. freq is the temporal rate of the inst. phase"...



### Frequency sampling에 대한 이해 

$$
\omega_k = \frac{2\pi}{N}k
$$

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1go6gkmt03xj20hf0f3gpl.jpg" alt="DFT-21 copy" style="zoom:50%;" />

원은 $2\pi$ 이니까 여기서 N개의 frequency를 샘플링하는 것. 

### DFT 

$$
X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] * e^{-j2\pi kn/N}
$$

이 수식을 다시 보자면, $X[k]$ 는 kth frequency의 spectrum이다. 

Input signal을 N개로 샘플링을 한다면, N개의 frequency sample에 대해서 각각 spectrum을 구하는 것이라고 한다. (N개의 input signal -> N개의 frequency spectrum) ---- 왜?? 

즉, NxN의 matrix를 계산하는 것. 

예를 들어 N=4일때, 각 frequency 마다의 complex sinusoid는 이렇다. 

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1go6gy37t0xj20x50u0gqi.jpg" alt="DFT-21 2" style="zoom:40%;" />

그럼 이걸로 $x=[1,-1,1,-1]$ 의 input signal의 DFT를 구한다면, 아래와 같이 frequency index=2인 친구만 4의 amplitude로 존재한다는걸 계산할 수 있다. 나머진 다 0이다. 즉, input signal $x$는 complex sinusoid basis 중 하나라는 뜻. 실제 오디오 프로세싱할때 이런 일은 없을 것이야. 

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1go6gyek56oj20st0uz76o.jpg" alt="DFT-22" style="zoom:40%;" />





DFT를 한문장으로 요약하자면, 

DFT is a projection of the input signal onto a finite set of complex sinusoids, so to find out how much of each complex sinusoids are present in the input signal. 



### Phase and magnitude of DFT 

Phase가 대체 뭔지 정확히 감이 안잡혔는데 이해했다. 

Spectrum은 각 frequency마다 amplitude랑 phase를 나타내주는데, amplitude는 input signal에서 그 frequency가 얼마만큼 있는지, phase는 그 frequency의 $t_0$이 어딘지를 알려주는 것이다. 

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1go6gmwlcsbj213i0u0qv5.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 10.29.17 AM" style="zoom:33%;" />

단순히 생각하자면, input signal이 아래 3개의 complex sinusoid의 합이라고 친다. 

Phase=0일때의 complex sinusoid와 다르게 각각의 frequency들의 시작점이 다 다른걸 볼 수 있다. 이게 DFT에서 계산되는 phase이다.

### DFT

In DFT, the value $N$ covers exactly 1 period of the input signal. 

So then why do we also sample frequency N times? So that inverse DFT work? IDK!!! 

교수님한테 물어볼래...

### Inverse DFT

Synthesizing/reconstructing the input signal from spectrum. 
$$
x[n] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X[k]e^{j2\pi kn/N}
$$
This still feels like magic. 



### Statically-typed language

Type checking happens during compile-time or run-time. 

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEgy1go84352zthj30wc0ky78v.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-04 at 8.45.27 PM" style="zoom:50%;" /> 

Img from [medium article](https://medium.com/android-news/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b#:~:text=A%20language%20is%20statically%2Dtyped,%2C%20FORTRAN%2C%20Pascal%20and%20Scala.)



In statically typed language, type checking happens during compile-time. Therefore, when you declare (and therefore bind) a variable with a type, you cannot change it later in the code. However, in dynamically-typed language, like python, you can. 

```
int data;
data = 5;
data = "Yo what are you doing?"
```

This will cause type error in Scala, C, etc, but is totally find in Python. 



Weakly vs strongly-typed 

* Weak means each variable's type 

* Strong means each variable can only be associated with one type and its type will not be changed no matter what 

```
data = "Yo I am back"
data = data + 3
```

If this runs without error, it means that the programming language is weakly-typed (Python, C).

If an error is raised, it is strongly typed. 



C is weakly-typed and statically-typed. 



### First-class functions

Means that functions can be used like values (integers, strings, etc).

### Data engineering 

**cron**  

Standard unix utility that can schedule to execute a job at a certain time. 

**Tables are "normalized"**(Database normalization)

Database structures are in normal forms. 

Normal forms means that there are less redundant. 

There is a trade-off between using normalized vs. denormalized tables. 

Benefit of normalization is that each table is simple and less cluttered, reducing space.

However, querying for some data requires series of table joins. 

On the other hand, denormalized tables are very easy to query, but are slow.

### N-th roots of unity 


$$
w_N^k = e^{j2\pi k/N}
$$
Note that, 
$$
(w^k_N)^N = e^{j2\pi k} = 1
$$
(Can check this by substituting $2\pi$ into the euler's equation). 

This means that there are $N$ distinct roots of unity. 

Applying it to DFT, it means that each of these frequencies are the sample frequencies of DFT sinusoids. 

Here is an example when $N=8$.

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEgy1goa50ft4mdj30pn0l3n3a.jpg" alt="KakaoTalk_Photo_2021-03-06-14-48-59" style="zoom:50%;" />

What we call as the fundamental frequency is $w_N^1 = e^{j2\pi /N}$.

The sinusoid at half the sampling rate is degenerate. 



### Fourier properties

* Linear : Adding two signals is equivalent to adding their two spectrums. 
  $$
  DFT(x+y) = DFT(x) + DFT(y)
  $$
  
* Shift : If you shift the input signal by $n_0$ and try to compute DFT, it is just multiplying a complex exponential to the original spectrum. 
  $$
  DFT(x[n-n_0]) = e^{-j2\pi kn_0/N} X[k]
  $$

* Symmetry 

  * If the input signal is real, the real part(absolute value) of the spectrum is even and the imaginary part (phase) of the signal is odd. 
  * If the input is real and even, the real part of the spectrum is even, but the imaginary part is 0 or a mulitple of $\pi$. 

  Below is an image of when the input signal is real.

* Convolution: convolution in signal domain is a multiplication in the frequency domain. 

  * Computationally simpler in the frequency domain
  * Is a reversible property

$$
DFT(x_1*x_2) = X_1 X_2
$$

* Energy conservation : How? 

* Zero-padding : If you compute DFT on zero-padded signal (padding on the right) , you can a more interpolated spectrum...

### Fast Fourier Transform

Computation of DFT is $N^2$. 

Symmetry 

Restrict input size to be size = power of 2 

Cooley-Tukey algorithm

In order to compute DFT of signal of any size -> FFT + zero-phase windowing

## 3/10

### B-trees (data mining)

Main motivation is to reduce the height of the tree to speed up search. 

B-tree is used for multi-level indexing of database. 

In case of B+ trees, only the keys in leaf nodes have record pointers. Therefore, every key in the tree will be copied in the leaf node, resulting in the leaf nodes that are dense index. 

Disk  -> DBMS 

* Tracks
* Sectors
* Blocks 
  * Block addres : (track #, sector #)
  * Particular byte : (track #, sector #, offset within that block)
  * ex. 512 bytes 
  * Read and write to disk in blocks 

Main memory (RAM) -> Data structure 

DB Index

* Dense, sparse multi-level index 

  

B-tree rule 

1. ceil(m/2) children 
2. Root can have min 2 children 
3. All leaf nodes at same level 

4. Creation is bottom up 



One page ideally contains one node. 

Maximum height of the tree is O(h).

Search, insert, delete is O(h).

### Relational database (data engineering)

Compound primary key

Star schema 

3NF is the one normally aimed for 

* Every table should have a primary key

* Atomic columns : Only one unseparable value per column (atomic for my use)

* No repeating groups :  ex. No list of items in a column 

* Non-key columns describe only the whole key : keys shouldn't be describing other keys

* No derived columns : columns are independent, and not redundant 

  

### Hearing perception (signal processing)

Equal-loudness curve

사람이 소리를 인지할때 loudness 와 frequency의 연관성을 보여주는 그래프이다. 

각 curve가 사람이 느끼기에 같은 크기의 소리라고 생각하는 (db, Hz) 페어들이다. 

예를 들면 50db, 60hz의 소리와 30bd, 400hz 소리를 같다고 인지한다고 한다. 

위쪽에 있는 curve들을 보면 경사가 비교적 낮은데, 이 뜻은 소리가 정말 클수록 frequency에 상관없이 다 비슷하게 크게 들린다는 것이다.

  * Shingling : Converting document to a set of  k-size shingles

  Shingle은 작은 조각들이라는 뜻인데, document에 있는 텍스트를 길이 k의 shingle들의 set으로 나타내는 방법이다. 실무에서 적용할때 k는 보통 길이가 9,10 정도 된다고 하고 이 길이의 이유는 shingle이 어느 document에 나타날 수 있는 빈도를 줄이기 위함이다. 빈도가 높으면 어느 document에서도 많이 나타날 것이고 그러면 비슷한 document를 찾는데 유의미한 정보가 줄어들기 때문이다.

### Scala

Why is scala (functional program) good for parallel, concurrent programming? 

* The language doesn't have mutation 
  * This is a useful characteristic for reducing error in parallel, concurrent programming
* Code runs more "spatially" than sequentially as in the imperative programming 



### DSP

Questions 

* k = 1 is the fundamental frequency and 2,3, ... are the harmonics. How do you select the right period so that k=1 is the fundamental?? 

### LSH 

The usage of LSH is to discover similar data. 

Ex. Detect duplicate documents

```pseudocode
for each document d :
		generate k-bit hashcode
		insert d into the hashtable
		check collisions (which are possibly duplicates)
```

The problem :

* Can detect exact duplicates, but not near-duplicates
  * Similar documents does not yield same hash code! 

Solution:

* Create multiple hash tables

### Efficient database search

* Spatial database : geometric한 정보를 저장하는 데이터베이스. ex. 2-d, 3-d maps, various shapes (polygons, lines, circles , etc) 

  이런게 있는 줄도 몰랐네 ㅎ 

* Spatial index : DB index to optimize queries in spatial database

* Types of spatial queries : K-NN query vs range query 
  * K-NN : Retrieve K nearest neighbors from the query object
  * Range : Retrieve all objects that are within the range X of the query object
* Spatial index allows us to ignore the unnecessary checks of data. If it is way out of range, we just ignore it, so that we don't have to check all the items in the database.

* Types of spatial indices 
  * Quad tree : Recursively dviding each feature space into 4 parts. Each node has $2^d$ children (d = n feature dimension). 
    * Cons : Only good for 2-d, 3-d space. Not for higher dimensions, since there will be too many subdivisions. ($2^d$)
  * Kd-tree: Binary tree where each level alternates between discriminators. 
    * How do you choose the right discriminator? How do you keep the tree balanced?
    * Cons : good for d ~ < 10 dimensions.
  * R-tree : Using MBRs (minimum bounding rectangles), group the objects recursively. 
    * Similar to B-tree : tree grows upward, node has N elements. 
    * Inserting new item : choose the most "suitable" MBR, which is the one that will have least amount of increase in volume.

To study more 

* Quad tree knn search : doesn't updating the list require lots of distance comparison? 
* R tree analysis

Continous time fourier transform (CTFT) vs. discrete time fourier transform (DTFT)

DTFT vs. DFT 



## 3/22

* If there is a discontinuity in the time domain,  you observe a more dispersed band of frequency 

* To prevent this discontinuity, we do windowing.

* Windowing tradeoff 
  * Looking at the spectrum of the window, if the peak width is wider = less precise , and if sidelobe is lower = removing artifact more effectively. You cannot get both. 
* DTFT is when N (number of samples / size of window) goes to infinity in DFT 
  * Therefore, the resulting frequency resolution is continuous 
* Bandlimited signal means the frequency is limited to a certain range



## 3/28

Imperative programming vs. Functional programming

* Imperative 
  * Assignment of values to variables

* Functional
  * Pattern matching 
  * No mutable states (no updates)
  * "Functions don't have side effects"
    * It doesn't modify the inputs
    * Functions can be run in parallel safely
  * Memory management is done by the program 

Lambda calculus 

* Functions are like a black box that takes in some input and returns some output 
* Can encode any computation (Church-Turing hypothesis)
* Basis for functional programming

```haskell
TRUE = lx.ly.x
FALSE = lx.ly.y
NOT = lb.b FALSE TRUE

NOT TRUE 
= (lb.b FALSE TRUE) TRUE
= TRUE FALSE TRUE 
= FALSE
```

* Recursion 

```haskell
Y = lf.(lx.f(x x))(lx.f(x x))
